Next.js 14 brings significant improvements to the developer experience and performance. In this post, we'll explore the key features and how to get started.

## The App Router

The App Router is now the recommended way to build Next.js applications. It provides:

- **Server Components by default** - Better performance and smaller bundle sizes
- **Nested layouts** - Share UI across routes while preserving state
- **Streaming** - Progressive rendering for improved user experience

## Setting Up Your Project

Getting started is straightforward:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Server Components vs Client Components

By default, all components in the App Router are Server Components. To use client-side features like `useState` or `useEffect`, add the `'use client'` directive:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Data Fetching

Fetching data in Server Components is simple - just use `async/await`:

```tsx
async function BlogPosts() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  const data = await posts.json();
  
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 provides an excellent foundation for building modern web applications. The combination of Server Components, the App Router, and built-in optimizations makes it a great choice for your next project.
